  /// What is OOP???
  /// A technique by which we create objects. And the concepts used in creating the applications
  /// by the interaction of these objects are called object oriented programming.
  ///
  /// Example: Person
  ///     Properties: Name, Age, Contact, Height, Weight.
  ///     Behaviors: Talking, Walking, Eating, Sleeping.
  ///
  /// Advantages:
  ///     Increase the reuseability.
  ///     Decrease Comlexity.
  ///     Maintaining the code.
  ///     Easy to understand.
  ///     Avoid the repeatation of code.
  ///
  /// RoadMap:
  ///     Classes
  ///     Objects
  ///     Constructors
  ///     Fetter Setter
  ///     Inheritence
  ///     Polymorphysum
  ///     Encapsulation
  ///     Abstraction
  ///     Abstract Classes
  ///     Interfaces
  ///     Maxin classes
  ///     Factory Constructor  etc...

  /// Dart Null Safety:
